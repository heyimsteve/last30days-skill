This represents a fundamental shift from enforcement-focused regulation to framework-based governance, with clear delineation emerging: SEC overseeing tokenized securities and CFTC managing digital commodities. Investment capital is flowing toward revenue-generating protocols, real-world assets (RWAs), and stablecoins, while speculative sectors like GameFi and NFTs face funding challenges. Institutional adoption is accelerating through new futures products and regulatory clarity, though concerns about exchange security and legitimacy persist. The market is transitioning from speculation to utility-driven adoption with compliance infrastructure becoming a competitive advantage.",
