## Example: Remotion Launch Video

**Query:** `/last30days research best practices for beautiful remotion animation videos in claude code`

**Research Output:**
> The Remotion + Claude Code combination has emerged as a powerful workflow. Users consistently report that simple, clear prompts with scene-by-scene descriptions yield the best results. Key insights: iteration is essential—most "beautiful" videos come from back-and-forth refinement rather than one-shot prompts.

**Then asked:** "Can you make a prompt for a 50 second launch video for my /last30days skill?"

**Generated Prompt:**

```
Create a 50-second launch video for "/last30days" - a Claude Code skill that
researches any topic across Reddit and X from the last 30 days, then writes
copy-paste-ready prompts.

SCENE 1 (0-8s): The Problem
Dark background. Text fades in: "You want to create something great."
Beat. Then: "But the internet is overwhelming."
Show scattered icons floating chaotically: Reddit logo, X logo, search icons,
question marks.
Slight camera shake to convey chaos.

SCENE 2 (8-16s): The Solution Reveal
Clean wipe transition. Calm, modern gradient background (deep purple to blue).
"/last30days" types in with a terminal cursor, monospace font.
Subtitle fades in below: "Instant expertise. Real prompts."

SCENE 3 (16-28s): How It Works
Split into 3 animated steps that slide in sequentially:
1. [Reddit + X icons merge] "Scans Reddit & X from the last 30 days"
2. [Brain/lightbulb icon] "Synthesizes what actually works"
3. [Document with sparkle] "Writes prompts you can copy-paste"

Each step has a subtle bounce animation on entry.

SCENE 4 (28-40s): Live Demo Feel
Simulate a terminal. Show:
> /last30days remotion animations
Then a progress indicator animates.
Results appear: "Analyzed 28 sources..."
Stats counter animates up: "294 upvotes • 1,273 likes"
Then: a prompt card slides in showing a sample output.

SCENE 5 (40-50s): Call to Action
Zoom out slightly. Everything fades except the logo.
Text animates in: "Research any topic. Get prompts that work."
GitHub icon + "github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill"
Tagline: "A Claude Code Skill"

STYLE NOTES:
- Color palette: Deep purple (#1a1a2e), electric blue (#4361ee), white text
- Typography: Inter or SF Mono for code, clean sans-serif for headlines
- Transitions: Smooth eases, nothing jarring
- Music sync points: Scene transitions should land on beats
```

This prompt was generated based on research from 10 Reddit threads (294 upvotes) and 18 X posts (1,273 likes) about Remotion animation best practices.

## Example: Discover Viral Trends (Dog as Human)

**Query:** `/last30days using ChatGPT to make images of dogs`

**Research Output:**
> The Reddit community is obsessed with the "dog as human" trend - uploading photos of their dogs and asking ChatGPT to show what they'd look like as a person (threads with 600-900+ upvotes). Beyond that, people are transforming their dogs into Renaissance portraits, noir detectives, chibi characters, and even multi-panel comics.

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. Upload reference photo first - ChatGPT works best with your actual dog's image
2. "As a human" transformation - The viral trend
3. Style/era transformations - Renaissance, noir, chibi, cartoon
4. Scene placement - French bistro, prison yard, detective office
5. Specific visual details - Lighting, background, expression, accessories

**Then asked:** "what would my dog look like as a human prompt"

**Generated Prompt:**

```
Look at this photo of my dog. Create an image showing what they would look like
as a human person. Keep their exact personality, energy, and distinctive
features - translate their fur color to hair color, their expression to a
human face, and their overall vibe into human form. Make it a realistic
portrait photo, not a cartoon.
```

*How to use: Upload your dog's photo first, then paste this prompt.*

**The Result:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/dog-original.jpeg" width="300" alt="Original dog photo"/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;→&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="assets/dog-as-human.png" width="300" alt="Dog as human"/>
</p>

Same golden fur → red hair. Same tongue out. Same harness. Same pink tag. ChatGPT nailed it.

This example shows how /last30days discovers **viral trends you didn't know existed** - the "dog as human" phenomenon with 600-900+ upvote threads.
